# Epoka Transport Management System
### CEN302 Software Engineering Group 3 project

Epoka University is located near the National Airport “Nene Tereza”, or 17 km from center of Tirana and 23 km from Durres. This means that the transport plays a vital role in the lives of the students, professors and the staff of this university.
Our program would facilitate this process by giving better administration and utilization of the buses or parking spaces. The users of bus transport will have to reserve a seat in order for the administrator to see how many seats will be taken on the bus. If it is needed, the admin can order a new bus to be sent to station. Regarding the parking part, the idea is quite the same: whoever would like to park his/her car in the Epoka’s parking lot, should book the place and inform about the staying time. 
So, to wrap it up the main functionalities will be:
-	Bus passengers can reserve their seat
-	The admin can control the bus status: capacity, is it departed or not
-	Car drivers can book their parking lot and specify the staying time
-	Manager can add and edit employee information

As described above, this program aims to give a more efficient way of using the transport resources since this procedure affects everybody’s life in our university.
